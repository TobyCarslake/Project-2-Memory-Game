# Project 2 - Matching Game

## Introduction
This game is a version of the classic memory game 'Concentration', where the player, faced with a face down deck of cards, turns over one card, then another, if they match leave them upturned, if not turn them both over and remember their position. The game ends when all cards have been matched.
This version contains 8 pairs of cards with unique symbols, arranged in a 4 x 4 grid.

## Features
The game has the following features:
- Star rating (based on number of moves used to win - more = better)
- Reset game button (represented by an arrow - resets the game board, stars and timer) 
- Timer (seconds taken in current game)
- Win message (displays the number of stars, moves and time taken to win the game)
